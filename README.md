# Diary_Of_A_Migraine_Sufferer
I'm trying to create an application I can carry with me so that I can properly document my daily journey along with my migraine Episodes. 
 This is kinda the frame work of how I'd love for this to look by the end of it all. 
 
When opening the application it has buttons for the list below. 
Food
Drink

Journal List 
Stats 
 
 
Under Food:  All buttons open a box in which they can type the food. 
Which Meal?

Drink:  
What was the item drank:  

Water , Milk, Juice, Other (allow for personalization of drink)  

Oz or mL of drinks 
 
Medicine :  
Have a list of medicines (editable in profile)  
Also have an OTHER section in case of different medicine than regular.  
    Maybe have interactions warnings pulled from the PDR? I.E. signs to watch for since they already took something etc down the line.

Editing symptoms will also log time that the new symptoms were logged into the  

entry I.E. "edit time" 

(Something else) will allow the user to log food or medicine while still keeping the clock running.  
 

Other Medical Issue: Are you journaling a reaction to (food) (drink) (medication) ? (No)

If a reaction entry is then also listed within the profile setting under "known Reactors"  

Journal List 
 

Allow all journal entries to become hyper links with the main points being listed before the hyperlinks I.E. Advanced Migraine, Food Entry and its meal, Medicine and Name.   

Stats 

This will let the user search their stats. In pro They can customize which stats or 'look ups' they see. The main ones will be how many times a migraine (advanced/normal) occurs in a user chosen period, how many meals are logged in a day, They also can see their most reported Other medical issue.  

Application will run in these modes: Light mode, Dark mode, Inverted or Custom. Custom mode will be available in pro mode and will change the upper bar, or selection bar and will cause the buttons to be similar themed with either white or black text dependent on color chosen (dark colors will have white text).  
 

Application will have a Text size feature, this will help those that are experiencing visual shifts causing it to be harder to input entries.  
 
ALL Users Entries will be able to export up to 45 Entries on free mode. Logs will be kept indefinitely just exports will be limited. 
 
Pro Users will be able to export up to 120 Entries per document.
